            Our mission is to instill an intrepid, entrepreneurial character in every individual through our
            trainings. This is why we are embarking on our own independent project to come out with a
            breakthrough tangible products (software and hardware) and we hope it can become one of
            our case studies for our class modules.

            <h3>Human Touch, Technology Driven, Knowledge Delivered</h3>

            This slogan reflects both our mission and vision. We believe in the principle of empowering
            our clients not just with the know-how but also on how to think beyond the machine.

            <br/><br/>

            <b>First Principle:</b> “human touch” ensure that we will always look at your problems from your
            perspective, so that you can form a solid understanding of the solutions that we provide you
            with, and certainly we will encourage you to innovate and do more wonders.

            <br/><br/>

            <b>Second Principle:</b> “technology driven” means that we will always employ technologies that
            are both reliable and dependable for your companies’ IT Solutions. New technology does not
            always deliver the result that you are expecting, that is why we are here to curate and pick
            the best technology possible that will revitalize your business functions.

            <br/><br/>

            <b>Third Principle:</b> “knowledge delivered” works for both our IT training and consulting services.
            We will make sure that you fully grasp the fundamental concept of the subjects and also
            knowing the essence of problem-solving. Your company’s size will get even bigger and so
            does your challenges will get even bolder, that is why it is necessary to achieve your goals
            by doing it simply, safely and quickly - AnakRimba will not compromise in enabling you to do
            just that.
